# Sprint 1 Summary

The entire team met approximately 3 times before the Sprint 1 presentation. We
met the Saturday, Sunday and Tuesday before the presentation. We had full plans
for the robot architecture, components, and strategy. The presentation had very
good feedback, but there were at least 2 major holes within our plan. Our
SolidWorks sketches, electrical diagram, and strategies were flawed. The sketch
was missing detail and components. The electrical block diagram had components
misplaced and some wrong relationships between parts, and our strategy for the
final competition needs to be reworked continuously. Otherwise, we had a very
good presentation. We also assigned a team leader and team scribe for
spring 2.

Team Leader: Mitchell Morrison

Team Scribe: Nathaniel Wesley.
