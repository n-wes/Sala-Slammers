# Wednesday, February 20, 2019, Team Meeting + Standup

Today is the start of Sprint 2 for our Wednesday section. The class time
consisted of the whole team performing a circuit debugging lab. We measured
voltage drops to analyze "mystery" circuits. These circuits consisted of four
100 ohm resistors and an unknown component. Each component was hidden under
a blue box, and the mystery component could be one of three things: a 1000 ohm
resistor, an open wire, or a 100 ohm resistor.<br>
After that, we began planning for our robot.
