# Wednesday, February 27, 2019, Team Meeting + Standup

Today, we finished the basic robot architecture for movement and beacon sensing. We mounted the arduino to the robot, and we still must mount the beacon onto the robot and build a cone for the beacon. We are still working on the wiring for the robot, and the program still has to be tested. We also did some calibration for the temperature sensor.
