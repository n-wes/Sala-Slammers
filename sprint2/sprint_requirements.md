# Sprint 2 Deliverables Checklist

- [x] Have a prototype frame built. Note that this does not have to match what you showed in your high level design presentation, but it will likely be similar.
- [ ] Have a detailed technical drawing for the intended final structure of your robot. This should be in more detail than what was presented in your high level design presentations, including exact dimensions, materials, etc. It should represent the intended final design that your prototype is working towards.
- [ ] Have a redesigned and complete bridge design technical drawing.
- [ ] Have a detailed design of salamander retrieval mechanism.
- [x] Upload all code to your teams GitHub repository.
- [x] Have a properly wired electrical system on your frame. This includes:
  - [x] A properly wired and charged battery with a volt meter
  - [x] Having it connected to a fuse block
  - [x] A properly wired kill switch
  - [x] Having one of the power outputs being regulated to 5V
  - [x] Having any components that require power be connected properly to this system. This includes motors, servos, Arduinos, sensors, etc.
- [x] Have a servo move to angles specified by a Reviewer, and have it return to its original position.
- [x] Drive three meters towards a beacon. Success in this task relies both upon how close to 3 meters your rover moves, and how much it deviates from a straight line path.
- [ ] Orient the drive direction of your robot towards a specified beacon character. (5 bonus points if your robot then drives three meters towards that beacon).
- [x] Updated budget using faculty and TA feedback.
- [x] Present two types of quantitative data about your robotâ€™s performance thus far. For two different aspects of your robot, produce a characterization of it accuracy and precision. These might include statistical data of replicate mechanical movements or sensor data.
- [x] Drive along the wall;provide a graphical representation of the cinderblocks in the terminal window. For example, X represents a near cinderblock, 0 is an opening: XXXXXXXXXXXX0000XXXXXX.
- [x] Have a temperature probe circuit completed and properly calibrated. You will hold the probe in an area of unknown temperature, and your control program should accurately display the temperature.

** At least one of these deliverable technical drawings must be in either SolidWorks or AutoCAD. Note that the tasks do not have to be done all at once. As in, each task can be done independently with separate programs for each task if necessary(except the bonus noted above).
